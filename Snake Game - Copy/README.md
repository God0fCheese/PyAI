## Overview

This project implements an AI that learns to play the Snake game using reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning with a neural network (Deep Q-Learning). The AI starts with no knowledge of the game and gradually improves by playing many games and learning from its experiences.

The project consists of four main Python files:
- `snake_game_ai.py`: Implements the Snake game environment
- `model.py`: Defines the neural network architecture and training mechanism
- `agent.py`: Implements the reinforcement learning agent
- `helper.py`: Provides visualization tools for monitoring training progress

## Game Environment

The `snake_game_ai.py` file implements the Snake game environment that the AI will learn to play.

### Key Components:

1. **Direction Enum**: Defines the four possible movement directions (RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN).

2. **Point namedtuple**: A simple structure to represent x,y coordinates for the snake's body parts and food.

3. **SnakeGameAI Class**: The main game class with the following methods:
   - `__init__`: Initializes the game window and settings
   - `reset`: Resets the game state for a new game
   - `_place_food`: Randomly places food on the game board
   - `play_step`: Advances the game by one step based on the action provided
   - `is_collision`: Checks if the snake has collided with a wall or itself
   - `_update_ui`: Updates the game display
   - `_move`: Moves the snake based on the action provided

### Game Mechanics:

- The snake moves in a grid-based environment
- The snake can move in four directions: up, down, left, right
- The goal is to eat food (red squares) to grow longer
- The game ends if the snake hits a wall or itself
- The AI receives a reward of +10 for eating food and -10 for collisions
- The game also ends if the snake moves in circles for too long without eating food

## Neural Network Model

The `model.py` file defines the neural network architecture and training mechanism used by the AI.

### Key Components:

1. **Linear_QNet Class**: A simple neural network with one hidden layer:
   - Input layer: 11 neurons (representing the game state)
   - Hidden layer: 256 neurons with ReLU activation
   - Output layer: 3 neurons (representing the possible actions)
   
   Methods:
   - `forward`: Performs a forward pass through the network
   - `save`: Saves the model weights to a file
   - `load`: Loads model weights from a file

2. **QTrainer Class**: Implements the Q-learning algorithm for training the neural network:
   - Uses Adam optimizer and Mean Squared Error loss function
   - Implements the Bellman equation for Q-learning
   
   Methods:
   - `train_step`: Updates the model weights based on a batch of experiences

### Training Process:

The neural network learns to predict the "quality" (Q-value) of each possible action in a given state. The training process uses the Bellman equation to update these predictions:

Q(s,a) = r + γ * max(Q(s',a'))

Where:
- Q(s,a) is the quality of taking action a in state s
- r is the immediate reward
- γ (gamma) is the discount factor for future rewards
- max(Q(s',a')) is the maximum predicted quality for the next state s'

## Agent Implementation

The `agent.py` file implements the reinforcement learning agent that interacts with the game environment and learns to play.

### Key Components:

1. **Agent Class**: The main agent class with the following methods:
   - `get_state`: Converts the game state into a feature vector for the neural network
   - `remember`: Stores experiences in memory for later training
   - `train_long_memory`: Trains the model on a batch of experiences
   - `train_short_memory`: Trains the model on a single experience
   - `get_action`: Selects an action using an epsilon-greedy strategy

2. **State Representation**: The agent represents the game state as an 11-element vector:
   - Danger straight (1 element): Is there a collision if the snake continues straight?
   - Danger right (1 element): Is there a collision if the snake turns right?
   - Danger left (1 element): Is there a collision if the snake turns left?
   - Current direction (4 elements): Which direction is the snake currently moving?
   - Food location (4 elements): Is the food to the left, right, above, or below the snake?

3. **Action Representation**: The agent represents actions as a 3-element vector:
   - [1,0,0]: Continue straight
   - [0,1,0]: Turn right
   - [0,0,1]: Turn left

4. **Training Function**: The `train` function implements the main training loop:
   - Get the current state
   - Choose an action
   - Perform the action and get the reward and new state
   - Train the model on this experience
   - Store the experience in memory
   - After each game, train on a batch of stored experiences

### Learning Process:

The agent uses an epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration:
- With probability epsilon, choose a random action (exploration)
- Otherwise, choose the action with the highest predicted Q-value (exploitation)
- Epsilon decreases as the agent plays more games, gradually shifting from exploration to exploitation

## Visualization Tools

The `helper.py` file provides visualization tools for monitoring the training progress.

### Key Components:

1. **Plot Function**: Creates a real-time plot of game scores and mean scores:
   - X-axis: Number of games played
   - Y-axis: Score
   - Blue line: Individual game scores
   - Orange line: Mean score over all games
   - Text annotations showing the latest score and mean score

## How It All Works Together

The entire system works together in the following way:

1. The `train` function in `agent.py` creates an Agent and a SnakeGameAI instance
2. For each step of the game:
   - The agent observes the current state of the game
   - The agent chooses an action based on this state
   - The game processes this action and returns a reward, whether the game is done, and the score
   - The agent observes the new state
   - The agent learns from this experience (state, action, reward, new state)
   - The experience is stored in memory for later batch training
3. When a game ends:
   - The agent trains on a batch of stored experiences
   - If a new high score is achieved, the model is saved
   - The game is reset for the next round
   - The scores are plotted to visualize progress

Over time, the agent learns to:
- Avoid collisions with walls and its own body
- Move towards food
- Develop strategies to maximize its score

## Reinforcement Learning Concepts

This project uses several key reinforcement learning concepts:

1. **Q-Learning**: A value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the quality (Q-value) of actions in states.

2. **Deep Q-Learning**: Using a neural network to approximate the Q-function, allowing the agent to handle high-dimensional state spaces.

3. **Experience Replay**: Storing experiences and training on random batches to break correlations between consecutive samples and improve learning stability.

4. **Epsilon-Greedy Exploration**: Balancing exploration (trying new actions) and exploitation (using known good actions) by choosing random actions with probability epsilon.

5. **Reward System**: Providing feedback to the agent through rewards (+10 for food, -10 for collisions).

## Getting Started

To run the Snake Game AI:

1. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:
   - PyTorch
   - Pygame
   - Matplotlib
   - NumPy

2. Run the training script:
   ```
   python agent.py
   ```

3. Watch as the AI learns to play the game! The plot will show the progress of the training.

4. The model will be saved automatically when a new high score is achieved, allowing you to resume training later.
